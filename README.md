## Overview

This folder contains the Kubernetes security scan results generated using Kubescape.

## Important Notes

- Due to technical limitations with Docker Desktop on my machine, I used **Killer Coda**, an online Kubernetes playground, to set up a local cluster and run the scan.
- Kubescape was used within Killer Coda to scan the cluster for security findings.

## Files Included

- `findings.zip` : A zipped archive containing detailed scan results and reports.
- `results.json` : The JSON file containing the Kubernetes security scan findings exported from Kubescape.

## How to Use

You can review the `results.json` file to see the detailed security findings of the Kubernetes cluster.
